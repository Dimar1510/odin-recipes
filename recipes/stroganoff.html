    <h3>These ground beef stroganoff noodles are a shortcut version of classic beef stroganoff in a one-pan version. The ultimate comfort food with flavorful ground beef, mushrooms, and egg noodles.</h3>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.
